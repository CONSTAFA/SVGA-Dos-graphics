# SVGA-Dos-graphics
You thought that SVGA (16,7 million colors) graphics were not possible in DOS? Your wrong! Proove is in the code of this lil'program.
The program of this code is for DOS. And it shows only 64k of the SVGA screen pixels. You need bankswitching or something
to get a full screen of SVGA pixels. I don't know about that. If you compile this code with TASM then you see the SVGA full
gray scale spectrum. TASM and the program of this code should be exectuted by DOSBox. By drag and dropping them into DOSBox.
